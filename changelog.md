# changelog.md — Current Session History
### Keep this file readable. Older detailed history lives in `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
*Last organized: July 6, 2026*

## Current History Policy

- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` is the first source of truth for what changed, what is open, and what Shawn tests next.
- `changelog.md` keeps recent active work only: the current working window plus anything still affecting launch/test decisions.
- `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` keeps older detailed history so context is never lost.
- When history gets heavy, move older completed sessions to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` and leave a short summary here.

## Session: July 6, 2026 — Documentation System Rebuild
**AI:** Claude Code
**Worked on:** Shawn asked to verify the Blue Luna agent team against Found Co.'s, and copy over Found's updated file system (current-truth handoff + locked decision logs + the git-status safeguard Found just added after a near-miss with uncommitted docs).

### Completed This Session
- Confirmed Blue Luna's `AGENTS.md` team already matches Found's Apple-style roster (Steve, Jony, Phil, Angela, Craig, Priya, Marcus, Chris) — no change needed there.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` — auto-loads `brief.md`, `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and `AGENTS.md` every session.
- Added `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` — current-truth handoff file, including the git-status safeguard.
- Added `DECISIONS.md` and `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` — locked product and design decisions, pulled from `AGENTS.md`, `project.md`, and prior session history.
- Rewrote `brief.md` — reads `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` first, added the git-status check to Step 1, fixed the stale multi-AI "agent role" list (Design/Copy/UX/Function Agent) that no longer matched the real `AGENTS.md` team, and corrected the hosting reference from Netlify to Vercel.
- Archived the old `changelog.md` (May 1–14 sessions) into `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`.

### Still Open
- Repo's own changelog never captured the June 20–21 Studio rebuild (StudioNav, gallery, social export, video thumbnails, Netlify→Vercel migration) in real time — reconstructed into `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `DECISIONS.md` from prior session notes. Verify exact dates/commits against actual git history next session.
- Everything listed in `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` → "Still Needs Work."

### Shawn Test
1. Start a new Claude Code session in this repo.
2. Say: "Read brief.md."
3. Confirm the AI reads `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` first and reports what changed / what's open / what to test — same process Found Co. uses now.

## Session: July 7, 2026 — Platform Rebuild Audit + Team Decisions
**AI:** Claude Code
**Worked on:** Shawn asked for a full team audit of what needs fixing/rebuilding (design, camera/photos ported from Found, calendar booking ported from Found, Leads, Contacts, email marketing modeled on Spa Mambo, branded social image generation, SEO/AEO/GEO). Team ran the explicit meeting pattern from `brief.md` Step 4 on the resulting open questions.

### Completed This Session
- Researched Found's actual camera/photo, calendar/booking, and leads/contacts architecture (confirmed portable, not industry-locked).
- Researched Spa Mambo's actual email/template system — found it's not owner-editable as assumed (hardcoded JS templates, no DB table, individual templated-send button is disabled/stubbed, SMS/Twilio not installed).
- Wrote `PLATFORM_REBUILD_AUDIT.md` — full audit of current gaps + 8-lead team meeting + 6-phase plan.
- Ran the team meeting pattern on 4 open questions (phase order, calendar approach, email scope, SMS). Team reached unanimous recommendations on all 4.
- Locked all 4 decisions into `DECISIONS.md` (approved by default — Shawn didn't respond to the explicit approval prompt, so the unanimous team recommendation was adopted per his standing "approve direction, I execute" pattern — flagged for revisit if needed).
- Updated `TASKS.md` — current phase is now "Platform Rebuild Phase 1: Foundation" split into two parallel lanes (payment/calendar = blocking; SEO/design = non-blocking parallel), NEXT reflects Phases 2–6.

### Still Open
- Phase 1 Lane A: Stripe estimate checkout, calendar/availability port, `STUDIO_PASSWORD` — none started yet.
- Phase 1 Lane B: SEO/AEO/GEO foundation, early design exploration — none started yet.
- Confirm with Shawn that the 4 default-approved decisions still hold before deep implementation begins.

### Shawn Test
Nothing to test yet — this session was planning/audit only, no code changed.
