3. New ideas go to `BACKLOG`, not `NOW`.
4. If a critical issue appears, pause and re-rank `NOW`.
5. Update this file before ending a session.

## CURRENT PHASE

**Platform Rebuild — Phase 1: Foundation (two parallel lanes) — APPROVED by Shawn 2026-07-07 (see DECISIONS.md).**

Full audit + team decisions: `PLATFORM_REBUILD_AUDIT.md`. Locked decisions: `DECISIONS.md` (July 7, 2026 entries).

Goal: fix what's broken (unfinished payments, no real calendar) and lay SEO groundwork, without blocking Jony's design work behind it. Package Configurator + Lead Automation (the original Phase 1) is complete — see COMPLETED below — this is the next phase of the full platform rebuild Shawn requested.

**Lane A — blocking, sequential:**
1. Finish Stripe estimate checkout (deposit + balance from `/q/[token]`) + PDF receipt generation + the end-to-end Stripe test that's been pending since May.
2. Build the calendar/availability system — port Found's `availability` / `availability_blocks` / `bookings` tables + slot algorithm, simplified for single-tenant (resolves the Google Calendar decision — Option B, real availability).

**Lane B — non-blocking, parallel (can start immediately alongside Lane A):**
3. SEO/AEO/GEO foundation — per-page metadata, JSON-LD (LocalBusiness + Service/Event + FAQ schema), sitemap.xml, robots.txt, Core Web Vitals pass.
4. Early design exploration (Jony) — does not need to wait on Lane A.

Exit criteria for Phase 1:
1. `STUDIO_PASSWORD` set.
2. Client can pay a deposit and balance on an estimate end-to-end, tested with Stripe test card.
3. PDF receipt generates correctly.
4. Public configurator shows Monica's real availability, not just a date picker with no constraints.
5. Every public page has unique metadata + JSON-LD; sitemap.xml and robots.txt exist.

## NOW (MAX 3)

1. **Decide how to fully validate the live Stripe checkout** (was: confirm test/live mode — now confirmed LIVE + a real deployed-key bug found and fixed 2026-07-08)
- Confirmed: Blue Luna's Stripe is in **live mode** (`sk_live_...`, `"livemode": true` per Stripe's own API). Also found and fixed the same category of bug as the Resend key: the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` deployed in Vercel was stale/wrong, causing `/api/stripe/estimate-checkout` to crash outright (empty 500) on every call. Shawn provided the real working key; swapped it in, redeployed, re-tested — the endpoint now returns a real, valid Stripe Checkout URL (`cs_live_...`).
- **Not yet done:** an actual completed payment. Since this is live mode, that means a real card gets charged. Options: (a) Shawn/Monica get Stripe **test-mode** keys (separate key pair, same account, toggle in Stripe dashboard) so future QA can happen without touching real money — recommended for anything beyond today's verification; (b) do one small real transaction on the existing $325 test estimate and refund it via the Stripe dashboard; (c) treat today's successful session-creation as sufficient confidence and let the first real client be the live proof.
- Owner: Shawn decides which validation approach he wants.

2. **Watch the Supabase auto-pause fix over the next 1-2 weeks**
- Status: MITIGATION SHIPPED 2026-07-08, monitor before considering fully closed
- Root cause was inconclusive (the old keepalive cron was correctly configured, enabled, and worked when manually triggered — but the DB still paused, suggesting Vercel Hobby-plan cron reliability, not a code bug). Replaced the silent ping with a real weekly business summary email (`/api/cron/weekly-summary`) — same protection, but a failure is now visible as a missing email instead of a silently broken site.
- If Shawn stops receiving the Monday/Thursday email, that's the signal Vercel's cron isn't firing — worth revisiting the free-external-pinger or Supabase Pro ($25/mo) options from that point.

## DONE (2026-07-07 to 07-08)

- ✅ **Email fully fixed and confirmed working** (2026-07-08): three stacked bugs found and fixed — unverified Resend domain (missing DKIM/SPF since May 14), an invalid `RESEND_API_KEY` in Vercel, and a completely missing MX record so nothing routed mail to Monica's real Namecheap-hosted mailbox at all. Shawn confirmed real-world: **can now both send and receive at `monica@bluelunaevents.com`.** Full detail in `DECISIONS.md`.
- ✅ **SEO/AEO/GEO 5 fixes shipped** (2026-07-08): `layout.tsx` JSON-LD `@type` fixed to `LocalBusiness`; fake `aggregateRating` (50 claimed, 3 shown) removed pending real data; `/quinceaneras` and `/graduations` converted from unnecessary client components to real Server Components, each now has its own tailored `metadata`; `FAQPage` JSON-LD added to both from existing FAQ content; `src/app/sitemap.ts` and `src/app/robots.ts` added. Commit `8951d7b0`.
- ✅ Stripe estimate checkout — `/api/stripe/estimate-checkout` (deposit + balance), webhook updated to write `estimates.deposit_paid`/`balance_paid`/`*_paid_at`/`*_stripe_session_id`/`*_stripe_payment_intent_id`.
- ✅ `/studio/estimates/[id]` detail view — client info, line items, payment status, manual "Mark Paid" for Zelle/cash/check, share link, PDF download.
- ✅ `/api/studio/estimates/[id]/pdf` — PDF receipt via `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- ✅ Fixed real bug: Studio estimates list page never fetched from Supabase (hardcoded empty array) — now fetches and derives display status from `deposit_paid`/`balance_paid`.
- ✅ Fixed real bug: `@react-pdf/renderer` was listed in `package.json` but never installed — `npm install` run, `package-lock.json` corrected.
- ✅ `STUDIO_PASSWORD` set (2026-07-08) — turned out the env var already existed but was blank (Shawn had created a placeholder earlier), which is likely why Studio login wasn't working. Value lives in Vercel + local `.env.local`, not in any committed doc.
- ⏳ Still needed before Lane A item 1 is fully done: confirm Stripe test/live mode (item 2 above), then live end-to-end test with Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` on the deployed site. A real test estimate already exists for this: `/q/6644927be9376058f4b3fa5dac11f034`.

## COMPLETED (Phase 1 core — do not reopen)

- ✅ config.ts consolidation — PACKAGE_CATALOG, ADD_ONS, PRICING_RULES, CONFIGURATOR_EVENT_TYPES, getPackagesForEvent()
- ✅ Packages.tsx, quinceaneras/page.tsx, graduations/page.tsx — import from config.ts
- ✅ src/lib/pricing.ts — computeTotal(), computeCustomTotal(), CustomBuild type, all rate constants, formatPrice()
- ✅ src/lib/supabase.ts — Lead type extended with all configurator fields incl. custom_build + custom_request
- ✅ src/components/ui/PackageConfigurator.tsx — 4-step dual-path configurator (package + à la carte custom build)
- ✅ src/app/get-a-quote/page.tsx — uses PackageConfigurator
- ✅ Supabase schema — all new columns live (ALTER TABLE run May 14)
- ✅ actions.ts — full insert of all fields, returns leadId
- ✅ Stripe Checkout — /api/stripe/checkout + /api/stripe/webhook + /booking-confirmed
- ✅ Resend emails — Monica notification + client confirmation (both with world-class HTML design)
- ✅ .claude/settings.json — Stop hook for end-of-session doc updates

## NEXT (in order)

1. **Configurator redesign — the core of the frontend rebuild** (APPROVED 2026-07-08, see DECISIONS.md + DESIGN_DECISIONS.md + FRONTEND_REDESIGN_AUDIT.md)
   - Tag gallery photos by component/color (garland tier, backdrop type, palette), not just `event_type` as today — prerequisite data work, owned by Craig/Priya
   - Configurator shows real matching gallery photos as the customer builds, not just a running price total (Jony's core idea)
   - Step 2 restructured so the guided package path is the clear default; "Build My Own" becomes a quieter secondary option, not a co-equal button (Angela's fix)
   - Surface the real deposit/cancellation policy (`PRICING_RULES.depositNonRefundableAfter`) next to the payment CTA — currently exists in code but is never shown to the client
2. **Phase 2 — Remaining visual rebuild (Jony-led)**: everything outside the configurator — homepage, Studio, remaining sections — one unified design language across public site + Studio.
3. **Phase 3 — Camera & Photos**: port Found's in-app `CameraSheet` pattern (zoom, torch, aspect ratio, album-at-capture picker), replacing the native file-input "Shoot" button. Keep existing heart/star model + locked video-thumbnail solution.
4. **Phase 4 — Calendar/Booking**: port Found's `availability`/`availability_blocks`/`bookings` tables + slot algorithm, single-tenant scoped, schema built for future iCloud CalDAV sync. Build Monica's Schedule tab and surface real availability in the public configurator. Follow-on: iCloud two-way sync — requires Monica to generate an Apple ID app-specific password.
5. **Phase 5 — Leads, Contacts, Email**: real Leads system (temperature/status/source, lead→estimate handoff), Contacts phone book, real owner-editable `email_templates` system + Studio editor + campaign send tool. SMS sending capability (Twilio) built alongside, activation gated on Shawn's A2P 10DLC registration.
6. **Phase 6 — Social / Branded Image Generation**: extend Social Export into an automatic branded-image pipeline off starred photos, caption assistance, lightweight posting view.
7. Component photos for custom builder — Image Agent task (see AGENTS.md → Image Agent). Source or generate 15–20 images for à la carte options in Step3Custom, from @BlueLunaMagic Instagram.
8. Next.js upgrade (14.2 → 16.x) — own session, test build after.

## BLOCKED

*(none currently — Google Calendar approach resolved 2026-07-07, see DECISIONS.md)*

---

## BACKLOG

1. Admin leads dashboard — superseded by Phase 5's real Leads system above.
2. Dynamic gallery (Supabase-backed, Monica manages photos without code deploy) — largely satisfied by the existing Studio media pipeline; revisit if gaps remain after Phase 3.
3. bl_pricing.json — decide: add to .gitignore? (contains private home address)
4. Next.js upgrade — currently on 14.2, needs upgrade to 16.x to fix 5 remaining npm audit
   vulnerabilities (DoS, XSS, cache poisoning). Deferred — low risk for this site type but
   must be done before any future launch hardening. Run as its own session, test build after.
